ZEUS NEEDS OMELETTES

You are the king of the egg kingdom. Zeus demands offerings of omelettes - that is to say, your subjects - on the sacrifical frying pan.

Naturally, your subjects don't appreciate being sacrificed, so they need to be appeased as well.

BALANCING TWO HAPPINESS METERS
- Zeus - falls over time, raised by sacrificing eggs
	INDICATE ZEUS' ANGER BY LERPING BACKGROUND BTW BLUE AND BLACK!
- Eggs - falls when someone sees you carrying an egg, raised by ???
- when either reaches 0, you lose - goal is to play for time

STEALTH ELEMENTS
- avoid being spotted! subjects have line of sight a certain distance in front of them
